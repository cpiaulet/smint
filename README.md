# smint
*smint* (Structure Model INTerpolator) is a tool to obtain posterior distributions on the H/He or H2O mass fraction of a planet based upon interpolation onto the Lopez & Fortney (2014) and Zeng (2016) model grids. 

If you use this code, please cite Caroline Piaulet as well as Lopez & Fortney (2014) and Zeng et al. (2016):

Feel free to contribute to this tool by raising issues or submitting pull requests. Any questions or requests can also be addressed to caroline.piaulet@umontreal.ca.

## Installation
You can install *smint* from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/cpiaulet/smint.git
    cd smint
    python setup.py install

### Dependencies
The dependencies of *stctm* are *NumPy*, *scipy*, *emcee*, *corner*, *astropy*, *pickle*, *configparser* and *argparse*.

### Example
Copy the three folders in smint/example/ wherever in your installation you want to run your code;

#### Standalone interpolator
You can run smint_analysis/example_interpolator.py in order to get familiar with the interpolation tool.

If instead you want to compute the distributions of water or H/He mass fractions given some planet and system parameters, you can use as reference one of the two other example scripts

#### MCMC fits
The two other example scripts in smint_analysis/ illustrate respectively how to compute the distribution of H/He (fhhe) or water (fh2o) mass fractions given a planet mass and radius (and a few other parameters for the H/He mass fraction). Parameters can be modified from the default values using a config file, two examples of which are provided as template_ini_X.ini. 

Here is an example one-liner to run a fit of the H/He mass fraction of a planet using planet paramters in the template_ini_hhe.ini config file:

    python calc_fhhe_planet_and_plots_example.py template_ini_hhe.ini

A few additional tips:
* The "ini file" (.ini) contains all the user input necessary to run the code, including planet and mcmc parameters, saving path and plotting options
* The path to an "ini file" needs to be provided to the python (.py) script (if different from the default) *or* provided as an argument if the script is run from the command line
* The python files can be run as long as the relative path to the models and results directories are correct;
* Each script illustrates an example of how to initialize, run and postprocess a fit using *smint*;
* The output files (pickle file recording the fit parameters, MCMC chains, csv file containing median and percentile values, corner plots) which are produced when running the example scripts as is are already in smint/example/smint_results ("test_new" files for the H/He fraction and "test_fh2o" files for the H2O mass fraction).
